# 🚰 Automatic Water Level Controller using Arduino

This project is an **automatic water pump control system** that maintains the water level in a tank.  
It uses **three water level sensors** to detect the level and automatically turns the pump ON/OFF.  
The status is displayed on a **16x2 LCD** and a **buzzer** alerts when water is low.
